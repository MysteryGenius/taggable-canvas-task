## 🙆🏻‍♀️ Explaining my choices

In the project I have chosen to not use JQuery as it is a dying library. Instead I have used only vanilla JavaScript. This however presented a fun challenge as I had write a lot more code to make the project work.
There is a space constraint as local storage can only store up to 5MB.

The project was built using flexbox layout however the canvas is not fully responsive.

There was a mistake on my part as the tags was not designed to draggable after they are created.

CSS was seperated into components as it is makes it easier to maintain.

## 🌱 Improvements

I would have liked to have used a more modern framework like Vue.js. This would have allowed me to have more structure and less code.
Attempting this project also showed me that I have been spoiled by the amount of abstraction that modern frameworks have. The canvas would have been made easier using a library like p5.js or pixi.js.

TailwindCSS is a great tool to use as it allows you to create a stylesheet that can be used across multiple projects.

Testing could have been more comprehensive as I have used Cypress to test the project. I have left out canvas testing which on hindsight was might be an issue as it was a large part of the project.

## 💻 Others

The project is hosted on Netlify. Eslint is used to ensure the code is clean. Prettier is used to format the code so that I can forget about it. Commitlint is used to ensure that my commit for this throwaway project is clean. Chose Yarn as it is faster than NPM.
