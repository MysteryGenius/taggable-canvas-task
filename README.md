# 💺 Secret-Lab

## 📝 Description

This is a simple project to help you understand my skills...I guess 😬

## 🙆🏻‍♀️ Explaining my choices

In the project I have chosen to not use JQuery as it is a dying library. Instead I have used only vanilla JavaScript. This however presented a fun challenge as I had write a lot more code to make the project work.
There is a space constraint as local storage can only store up to 5MB.

There was a mistake on my part as the tags was not designed to draggable after they are created. This would have been a feature I would have worked in using Konva as it is a library that I have used.

## 🌱 Improvements

I would have liked to have used a more modern framework like Vue.js. This would have allowed me to have more structure and less code.
Attempting this project also showed me that I have been spoiled by the amount of abstraction that modern frameworks have.

Testing could have been more comprehensive as I have used Cypress to test the project. I have left out canvas testing which on hindsight was might be an issue as it was a large part of the project.
