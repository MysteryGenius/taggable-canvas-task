## 📝 Description

This is a simple project to help you understand my skills.

## 🙆🏻‍♀️ Explaining my choices

In the project I have chosen to not use JQuery as it is a dying library and I would like to help it die faster. Instead I have used only vanilla JavaScript. This however presented a challenge as I had write a lot code to make the project work.
