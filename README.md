# 💺 Secret-Lab

## 📝 Description

This is a simple project to help you understand my skills.

## 🙆🏻‍♀️ Explaining my choices

In the project I have chosen to not use JQuery as it is a dying library and I would like to help it die faster. Instead I have used only vanilla JavaScript. This however presented a challenge as I had write a lot more code to make the project work.
There is a space constraint as local storage can only store up to 5MB.

## 🔧 Tooling

- [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org/)

## 🌱 Improvements

I would have liked to have used a more modern framework like Vue.js. This would have allowed me to have more structure and less code.
Attempting this project also showed me that I have been spoiled by the amount of abstraction that modern frameworks have.
